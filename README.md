# Real-time event detection using convolutional neural networks and validation with multimodal large language models

**ðŸ“Œ This project is part of my Master's thesis and is currently a work in progress.**  
This project seeks to  develop a multi-frame-per-second convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for a multi-class detector capable of running efficiently on 'edge' processing platforms for real-time video analysis, to detect events.
Implement a fact-checking mechanism based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which will analyze in detail the 'evidence' provided by the detector and decide whether it is a false positive or a real event.


## ðŸš€ Features
- Incorporate state-of-the-art transformers library to the new coming MLLMs of the close future.
- Make use of small MLLM, able to run in a normal GPU and edge computing platforms.
- Develop several combinations of the components of the architecture to separate evaluation
- Developing the use of different multiclass detectors
-Validation can be requested based on rules derived from detections that describe events. These rules will serve as a toolbox for future users.
